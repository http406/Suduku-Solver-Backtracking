# Suduku-Solver-Backtracking
This Python code defines functions to solve a Sudoku puzzle using backtracking. You can customize the board variable to represent any Sudoku puzzle you want to solve.

# Description 

In this code:

- The train_model function: trains a neural network with random data for a binary classification task.

- The evaluate_partial_solution function: evaluates a partial Sudoku solution using the trained neural network.

- We define the Sudoku puzzle as a 9x9 grid and use the evaluate_partial_solution function to evaluate its goodness. This integration allows us to use the neural network as a heuristic to guide the Sudoku solver's search for a solution. The provided neural network model is simple and may not be directly applicable to solving Sudoku puzzles. Further refinement and customization of the neural network architecture and training process may be necessary for better performance.
